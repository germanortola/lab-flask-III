## Introduction

On this lab, you will continue working on the API you created on the previous lab. On this lab, you will create a connection to a MySQL database.

The goal is to have this workflow:

Browser endpoints < function defined under endpoint < function that queries < function that establishes connection

This way, we will manage to run SQL queries by just passing one word/one endpoint.

### Iteration 1

Copy the API you created. It should look like this:

```bash
your-code/
    main.ipynb
.gitignore
README.md

small-api/
    main.py
    config/
        sql_connection.py
    tools/
        sql_queries.py
```

- From your terminal, run: `python main.py`
- In that terminal, you'll get feedback of your prints and the errors.
- After the server is up and running you'll be able to go into your browser and access the endpoints you defined.

### Iteration 2

You now have an API that runs queries based on parameters. Now, we will seed a database. We do this through POST methods.

Post methods can only be done through python.

```python
requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:9000/insert-into-employees", params = params)
```

1. Create a route with the endpoint: `"/insert-into-employees"`
2. Define a function in config/sql_connection.py that that will receive as arguments whatever you want to insert.
3. Call that function under another one below your route.
4. From python, create a dictionary named params where each key you're passing is the name of the column and each value will be your inserted value. Then:

```python
requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:9000/insert-into-employees", params = params)
```

### Iteration 3

Create and parametrize as many endpoints as you find useful. Is there some aggregations you can do?

### Iteration 4

1. Choose a database: a csv of your liking
2. Upload that database to [free sql database](https://www.freesqldatabase.com/)
3. Establish a connection to your database through Workbench to your db on the cloud

### BONUS

Deploy your API to [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git). This will allow you to have your API up and running on a remote address.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
